SWSheets is a simple application for creating, storing, sharing, and printing Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars role-playing game characters online. It is not intended to enforce any rules of character building or provide any aids beyond calculating die rolls.

## Feature Suggestions & Bugs

Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/swsheets/swsheets/issues).

## Setup

The easiest way to get the application up and running locally is with Docker.

- If this is your first time with the application, create and seed the database.

  - **NOTE**: If this is not your first time running the app, this will drop the local development database, so ensure that you want to do that.

  - Make sure the directory you are running this is in is known to Docker.
    On the macOS you can configure shared paths from Docker -> Preferences... -> Resources -> File Sharing.
    See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac for more info.

```
docker-compose run --rm app setup
```

- Run the application.

```
docker-compose up
```

- If you ever want to run ad-hoc `mix` tasks, you can pass arbitrary `mix` tasks to `docker-compose`.

```
docker-compose run --rm app doa.mixthing
```

- Visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

## Testing

- Install the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hook in order to automatically check formatting of your Elixir code.

```
pre-commit install
```

- You can run your tests inside the container with `docker-compose`.

```
docker-compose run --rm app test
```
