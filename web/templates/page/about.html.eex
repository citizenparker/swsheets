    <h3>FAQs</h3>

    <p><strong>Who made this?</strong></p>

    <a id="open-source"></a>

    <p>SWSheets is run by a few folks - you can see the details on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/swsheets/people">Github SWSheets team page</a>. This site is also the work of many volunteers who help in many ways. <a href='/thanks'>See the full list of contributors</a> for more info.</p>

    <p><strong>Is this really free? What is this open-source thing you mention?</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, this is totally free and will remain that way. All content on this website is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC 3.0 US</a> license which means we couldn't make money off it even if we wanted to. No ads, no charges, nothing.</p>

    <p>As for "open-source," it just means that all the code that powers this website <a href="https://github.com/swsheets/swsheets">is available online</a> and is open to contributions from others.</p>

    <p><strong>You should add a bunch of logic to enforce the rules of character creation.</strong></p>

    <p>That's a lot of work, and <a href="https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89135-another-character-generator/">OggDude's Character Generator</a> does that better.</p>

    <p><strong>Why does this exist when <a href="https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/89135-another-character-generator/">OggDude's Character Generator</a> exists?</strong></p>

    <p>OggDude's tool is great! We wanted a tool to manage characters online and easily share them with a group, though. Also, OggDude's is Windows-only.</p>

    <p><strong>I found a bug!</strong></p>
